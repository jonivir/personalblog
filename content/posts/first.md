So I went and put up a website. 

What I'm going to do with this website is still very much unclear (and to be realistic, it aint never going to be "ready"). But at the moment I'm feeling like writing a blog, so there's probably going to be posts about... *something* published completely sporadically.

In addition to that unresistable sales pitch you can see what [books](/books/) I'm currently reading and have previously read. Maybe I'll even write some thoughts about those in here? Who knows.

Also I'm thinking of adding my collection of physical music which consists of (currently pathetic amount) cd:s and vinyls. (I've yet to plummet as deep as buying casettes, but who knows what the future holds). Of course at the moment my trusty 90's cd-player which I got for 40€ second-hand isn't working so those CD:s are just glorified paperweights. But I fixed it already once so I believe in my inner technician. (The fix was just to open the case and manhandle few of the moving parts and close the case, but we'll keep that between us. + The fix lasted about 2 weeks so, fingers crossed.)

And that's not all! I might but up a some kind of links/bookmarks collection of all the useful, funny and random stuff I have found during my travels in the interwebs.

So tl;dr I'm trying to create my own little corner in the internet as a some kind of refuge from all the algorithms and their mind numbing slop.

Speaking of mind numbing slop, I'm thinking of writing my first proper blog post about why I've started to buy physical media (music, movies etc.) and leaving most of the streaming sites. **So stay tuned, and hit that like button and subscribe!**
