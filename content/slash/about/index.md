Nearly middle-aged (fuck that feels horrific saying that out loud) white guy from Finland. At daytime a designer, project manager and curious mind, at night the batman... Just kidding! (or am I?) 

In my spare time I like to read books, play games, play with computers, imagine being a Tour de France rider with my bike and lycra, cook (former professional cook), listen to music, watch tv and play with our dog (dog tax at he end of the page). In addition to those more enduring hobbies and interests, I tend to (hyper)fixate in all sorts of hobbies and activities. Latest wast a brief interlude in the world of knitting. I managed to finish two beanies and almost one woollen sock. Some other previous dapplings include painting, journaling (on pen and paper), I really would like to be a kind of person who jots down notes and thoughts in their notebook. Also more periodically I tend to get excited about winetasting, beertasting, specialty coffees and all sorts of annoying snobbery.

But most of all I am, and have always been a huge nerd. Ever since we got a 133MHz Pentium in our childhood home I've been enamored by pretty much all things computer. I have build several websites with different techniques, first in plain html and css, then worpdress etc. and now lastly I decided to try Hugo, which this page has been built on. Currently I'm also dappling in all things homelab and started self-hosting several different applications and services few weeks ago. Also I'm planning to put some kind of NAS together either building my own, or just going the easy (and boring) route of buying something readymade.
