> It's december (still surviving the Whamageddon! :muscle: ). Thinkin of participating in the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2025). It's not like I should bw studying or antyhing.

> I've been away from Twitter/X for about 2 years now, but recently I've been feeling like joining something similar, so I went and joined Mastodon. (If you want, feel free to follow me: https://mastodontti.fi/@jonivirtanen).

> Procrastination 101: If you cant be bothered to work on the courses you're currently enrolled (and need to finish before christmas so you can get your masters) you can always try to start studying something new for example a open university course about [Full-stack web development](https://fullstackopen.com), 'cause why not? Right? That will surely help to relieve your stress about the impending dedalines. :sweat:
